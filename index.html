    <h2 id="green">Defining Accessible Design</h2>
      <p>Not all human beings have the exact same capabilities - in fact, humansâ€™ abilities range on a wide spectrum. When we design websites for people to use, what good are they if they are only useful to some people? People who are hard of hearing, hard of seeing, or who suffer from other disabilities make up a good portion of the population, and therefore, a good amount of people cannot use websites the way that they were intended to. </p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Accessible design</strong> is a term for design that is able to be used by <em>all</em> people with a range of abilities.</p>

    <h2>Accessible Design in the Past</h2>
    <p>Accessible design became a serious topic of conversation within the web development field in the 1990s. In 1994, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded. Then, in 1999, the first version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which is also known as WCAG, came out. Guidelines included in these early versions were helpful, but through time, the guidelines were updated several times to meet the needs of the expanding web languages as well as the needs of all humans.

    <h2>The Future of Accessible Design</h2>
    <p>Today, it is still a challenge to get all companies and web developers on board with making their websites fully accessible. Many claim that they cannot achieve interesting enough designs with such guidelines, while others claim that it would take too much time and cost too much money to make their websites accessible. Neither of those arguments are true, and the goal is to get <em>everyone</em> to design for <em>everyone</em> in the future!</p>
