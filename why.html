    <h2 id="green">Why is Accessible Design Important?</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, there are no official laws that require a web developer to use accessible design. So why do it, then?</p>
<br>
      <p>People of all ages, abilities, genders, and levels of education should have equal access to information and features on websites that we create.</p>
<br>
      <p>If one really needs convincing beyond that, on a more selfish note, more people will be exposed to your website if it is available for use for all people. More exposure means more income for businesses.</p>
